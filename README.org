* ORGTeXer

A processor for orgtex-mode - this is Org with TeX mixed in.

The reason for this processor is that I often write text in Emacs Org
mode and want output as LaTeX or HTML. These, in turn, can be
converted to PDF or Word documents for collaborators. ORGTeXer also
has support for bibtex citations.

There exists also the older wikitexer project which did the same for
Wikimedia style input files mixed with Tex. Both projects are
published under a liberal BSD-style license.
