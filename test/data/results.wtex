=== Genome-wide identification of positive selection ===

Gene families in plant-parasitic nematodes can be subject to positive,
diversifying selection.  To identify such gene families, predicted CDS
from the genome of a species were clustered at a conservative 70\%
amino acid sequence identity with the BLASTCLUST tool, part of the
NCBI-BLAST software suite (see~\ref{Methods}). For the plant parasitic
nematode, \Mi\ out of a total of \Mi_CDS_num\ predicted CDS,
\Mi_cClusters\ clusters were identified containing four or more
sequences.  Of these clusters, \Mi_c_perc\ clusters contain
hypervariable codon locations showing significant evidence of positive
selection ($p<0.05$), according to the CODEML algorithm of
PAML\cite{Yang:2007}.  For five other nematodes species with predicted
CDS available (i.e., \Ce, \Gp, \Mh, \Pp, and \Ts) we used the same
approach to identify CDS-based positively selected clusters (\psc)
(see supplementary figure online \gwpfig\ at \href{http://biobeat.org/GWP/}{http://biobeat.org/GWP/}).

To expand the genome search space, ten nematode species and one
oomycete (i.e., \Bm, \Bx, \Cb, \Ce, \Gp, \Mi, \Mh, \Pp, \Sr, \Ts, and
\Pi) were included to identify sequence families from ORFs. ORFs were
generated by splitting the full genome sequence into fragments on stop
codons in six reading frames.  Only sequences were included in the
cluster analysis that contained more than 60 codons and were less than
10\% masked (see methods). For \Mi\ \Mi_oClusters\ ORF clusters were
identified containing four or more sequences having a sequence
identity of more than 70\%, out of a total of \bignum{\Mi_ORF_num}
ORFs. Of these clusters, \Mi_o_perc\ clusters contain hypervariable
codon locations showing significant evidence of positive selection
($p<0.05$) (\gwpfig).

To estimate the overlap between ORF \psc\ and CDS \psc, a
within-species nucleotide MegaBLAST search was executed (\pval).
MegaBLAST is optimised for aligning nucleotide sequences that differ
slightly\cite{MegaBLAST}.  All matches were filtered for
alignment-length $>60bps$, resulting in \bignum{252089} significant
ORF hits against \bignum{19632} (or 96\%) of CDS for \Mi, i.e., almost
all CDS matched one or more ORFs.  Using these results, we identified
all individual ORF sequences that make up ORF PSC and matched them
against CDS sequences that make up CDS \psc.
\count_opsc_ps_ps_perc\ ORF-based PSC contained one or more sequence
matches and thus overlap with CDS-based PSC.  The other way,
\count_cpsc_ps_ps_perc\ CDS-based PSC contained one or more matches
and thus overlap with ORF-based PSC.  At the PSC level, ten CDS PSC
were matched by more than one ORF PSC, possibly because of shared
domains/motifs. For example, the large CDS cluster0001 matches the
GATA transcription factor gene families with multiple ORF \psc\ hits
(supplementary tables online \href{http://biobeat.org/GWP/opsc\_cpsc\_matches.tsv}{ORF CDS
  matches}).  Altogether, the combined \Mi\ CDS-based and ORF-based
positive selected clusters resulted in a total of
$325-59+43=\Mi_unique_PSC$ unique paralogous sequence families subject
to positive, diversifying selection.


=== Identification of \psc\ that are conserved 
in annotated species ===


Not all gene families under positive, diversifying selection, are
involved in plant-parasitism. To prune \psc\ that have conserved
functional properties in non-parasitic organisms, \psc\ were
identified that have similarity to members of the NCBI curated
non-redundant Refseq database which contains predicted proteins from
over \bignum{30000} organisms\cite{Pruitt:2012}. For all 11 genomes of
the species in this study, a \psc\ was considered conserved when its
member sequences shows significant BLAST similarity (\pval) to
organisms annotated in Refseq.


For \Mi, \Mi_cblast_refseq_perc\ of CDS-based \psc\ and
only \Mi_oblast_refseq_perc\ of ORF-based \psc\ showed significant
similarity to accessions from other organisms in protein databases
After subtracting the \psc\ harbouring sequence conservation in
multiple other organisms we identified a total of $325-36+43-27=305$
unique \psc\ that may be associated with plant-parasitism of \Mi\ (see
\gwpfig\ and supplementary tables online 
\href{http://biobeat.org/GWP/Mi\_CDS\_refseq\_matches.tsv}{Refseq1} and
\href{http://biobeat.org/GWP/Mi\_DNA\_refseq\_matches.tsv}{Refseq2}).

=== Identification of conserved evidence of positive selection across
nematode genomes ===

To identify PSC that display `conserved' footprints of adaptive
evolution (i.e. PSC that show homology to PSC in other species) all
sequences contained in PSCs from the 11 genomes were stored in a
searchable database. The members of this database were used as queries
in a BLAST search (\pval) on the database itself to identify PSCs from
different genomes sharing significant sequence similarity. 
The number of PSC of \Mi\ with significant sequence similarity with
PSC from other species in the full comparison set was \Mi_cblast_species_perc\ and \Mi_oblast_species_perc\, for CDS PSC and ORF PSC, respectively. Of those, respectively \Mi_cplantp_perc\ and
\Mi_oplantp_perc\ showed similarity to predicted proteins from plant parasitic
nematodes only (\gwpfig). Most of sequence similarity was found between
ORF-based positively selected clusters in two closely related
root-knot nematode species \Mi\ and \Mh. Some of the
ORF-based PSC show sequence similarity with the more distantly related
plant-parasite nematode \Gp. No sequence similarity was found
between PSCs from \Mi, and animal-parasitic nematodes or \Pi. 

Eliminating the PSC of \Mi\ that
have sequence similarity either with the predicted protein sequences
from other organisms in RefSeq or with PSC from other genomes in the
searchable database resulted in 84 PSC
uniquely associated with plant parasitism by root-knot
nematodes in this study (\gwpfig).

% GS: While there was some overlap between the results of the comparison set
% and Refseq, there was almost no overlap with the plant-parasitic hits
% which suggests the special purpose BLAST database contains information
% not harvested from RefSeq. 

% Similarly, we also found that XX PSC that are only
% conserved among the different plant-parasitic nematode species in our
% searchable database, some of which may reflect common strategies in
% plant parasitism by sedentary plant-parasitic nematodes. 

=== Identification of \psc\ encoding nematode secreted proteins ===

Nematode effectors secreted into the apoplast and cytoplasm of plant cells
typically carry a classical eukaryotic amino-terminal signal peptide
for secretion and lack a transmembrane domain in the mature protein
sequence. To identify PSCs harbouring putatively secreted proteins, we
used SignalP\cite{SignalP} and PHOBIUS\cite{Kall:2004} algorithms to
predict whether sequence members of PSC in our database harboured an
N-terminal signal peptide and possible transmembrane domain(s) (see
methods).

For \Mi\ both SignalP and PHOBIUS predicted that 20 (47\%) CDS-based PSCs contained members
with a signal peptide for secretion. Out of those, 13 CDS PSC were predicted
to lack TMM activity. Meanwhile, 43 (13\%) ORF PSC contain SP
according to SignalP and 50 (15\%) according to PHOBIUS. Out of those, 35 ORF-based
PSC were predicted for TMM activity (supplementary tables online \href{http://biobeat.org/GWP/Mi\_signalp\_matches.tsv}{S1} and
\href{http://biobeat.org/GWP/Mi\_phobius\_matches.tsv}{S2}). 

Functional \ofam\ consist of exons and contain sequences that are
truncated from the 5' and/or 3' end. To identify the full-length genes
that correspond to genes from \Mi\ ORF \psc\ we reused above MegaBLAST
results (for \Mi\ \bignum{252089} significant ORF hits against
\bignum{19632} (96\%) of CDS).
The full-length CDS sequences which
match the short ORF PSC sequences out resulted in identification of an
additional 19 SP-protein containing ORF PSC, whereof 11 lack a \tmm.

The three sets of SP-proteins (20 from CDS data, 50 from ORF data and
19 from ORF expanded MegaBLAST) were checked for overlap and resulted
in a total of \final_tally\ \psc\ that may be secreted by
the plant-parasite \Mi\ (supplementary tables online
\href{http://biobeat.org/GWP/Mi\_77psc.xlsx}{S3}).

=== A database of positively selected gene families from nematode ===

To make the analysis reproducible and the data available for further
analysis we made the software available for download under a free and
open source software license together with a queryable database containing the full body
of data analysed in this study.  The database includes computed \psc, annotated sequence
homology from both Refseq and the special BLAST database of species
created for this study, as well as the annotation from \sp\ and
\tmm\ topology predictions. This database comes in the form of a
linked data resource description framework (RDF) graph containing
\bignum{14054846} data points (triples) which can be loaded, for
example, in a 4store triple-store\cite{4store} and allows further
searches in data and relationships\cite{Biohackathon:2010}.
